        <p>Born and raised in Seattle. Graduated from UW but still trying to figure what I wanted to do with my life.  A year later I enrolled in pastry school. I interned in France for 3 months after I graduated.  Been baking for the past 8 years. What I loved about baking is the creativity of it but it's not as challenging as it was in the beginning.  I have a lot of different of hobbies and it all revolves my creativity. My husband suggested I try coding. I started learning on my own and I found that it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. Just a lot of memorization.  It still is challenging but it's what I'm looking for that also incorpates my creativity.</p>
